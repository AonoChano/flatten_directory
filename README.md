# Flatten Directory Tool
This repository contains a Python script that flattens a directory structure by moving all files from subdirectories to the root directory. This can be useful when you need to consolidate files in a messy directory hierarchy or when you want to simplify file organization.
## Features
Efficient flattening: The script traverses the entire directory tree and moves each file to the root directory while handling name conflicts gracefully by automatically renaming files if necessary.
## Portable: Written in Python, this tool can be run on various operating systems as long as Python is installed.
## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using python flatten_directory.py.
The script will then start flattening the directory structure. You will see log messages indicating which files are being moved.
## Note
Be cautious when using this tool as it will overwrite files with the same name in the root directory. Make sure to backup important data before running the script.
